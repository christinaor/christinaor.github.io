# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal page for sharing my background and showcasing some of my work. The page was built with React, TypeScript, Sass/SCSS, and kickstarted with Vite. Ahead are instructions on spinning it up.

### Installing packages

```
npm install
```

### Development setup

This allows the benefits of compiling and hot-reloading during development.

```
npm run dev
```

### Production setup

This will compile and minify the build for production.

```
npm run build
```
